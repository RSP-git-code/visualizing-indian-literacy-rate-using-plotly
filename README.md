# Literacy Rate Visualization Across Indian States
## Overview
This project visualizes the literacy rates of Indian states using a **Choropleth map**. It leverages **Plotly** for interactive map plotting, with data sourced from an Excel file and geographic boundaries from a GeoJSON file.

## Files
- **states_india.geojson**: GeoJSON file defining Indian state boundaries:[https://un-mapped.carto.com/tables/states_india/public/map].
- **literacyrate_data.xlsx** (optional): Dataset containing the literacy rates for each Indian state. You can even use pd.read_html(url) and put wikipedia  by inserting the url

## Key Libraries
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `plotly.express`
- `json`
- `numpy`

## Output
The project generates an interactive map, as shown below, depicting literacy rates across states in India.
